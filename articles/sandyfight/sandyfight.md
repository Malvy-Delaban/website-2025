# About Sandy Fight
Sandy Fight is a casual Third-Person Shooter (TPS) where you can play with up to 10 players on the same map. The goal is to top the scoreboard by outmaneuvering and outshooting your opponents. In this game, you have infinite ammo, but the shots are slow, so anticipating your target's movement is key, similar to games like Up Gun.

The environment is a small city with the freedom to jump, climb buildings, and sprint on walls, offering verticality and creative movement. Every time a player is killed, they respawn at the furthest spawn point from any other player, ensuring a dynamic and ever-changing gameplay experience.

# Team & development
Sandy Fight was a duo project created within 24 hours during an internal game jam at ESMA Toulouse, my video game school. At the time, I was in my first year, and it was my first experience developing a multiplayer game.

The team:

# Inspirations
We drew inspiration from ancient Mesopotamian architecture as well as Berber and mudbrick architecture found across North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. The works of Omar Abdullkader and Fred Taylor also influenced the shape and design of our buildings.

# Difficulties
Developing Sandy Fight was an intense experience, especially given the limited 24-hour timeframe. One of the most significant challenges was learning to implement a multiplayer system. I had to handle client-server communication, synchronization, and the creation of a lobby system before even getting to the core gameplay mechanics. Most of my time was spent on these foundational elements, but in the end, I’m proud of the result, especially considering it was my first multiplayer game.

Another major challenge was the physics system. I had to create the player controller from scratch, particularly the wall climbing mechanics and managing invisible barriers. The tricky part was ensuring players could climb buildings while preventing them from scaling the arena limits. If I had more time, I would have spent additional effort on providing clearer feedback for these invisible walls, as their behavior was not intuitive.

Other areas that would benefit from refinement include the overall feedback system. Many aspects, such as the scoreboard, player color synchronization, and feedback on actions (like hits), were rushed and lack polish. There’s also no clear indicator when a player joins the game, and some bugs in the scoreboard made it confusing.
