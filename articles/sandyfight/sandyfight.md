# About Sandy Fight
Sandy Fight is a casual Third Person Shooter. You can play up to 10 player on the same map and your goal is to be on top of the scoreboard. You have infinite ammos and your shoots are really slow, forcing you to anticipate your target's move just like games like "Up Gun". You can also jump around in the little city and climb building while sprinting at walls / jump high above your opponents. Every time someone is killed, they respawn on the spawnpoint the most further away from any player. 

# Team & development
This project was made in duo with my other half within 24h in the context of an internal game jam of my video game school at ESMA Toulouse. It was my first game jam and I were at the time in first year. It was also my first experience in developping a multiplayer game.

The team:

<a href="https://www.malvy-delaban.fr/">DELABAN Malvy - Multiplayer & gameplay developper</a>

# Inspirations
We took inspirations in ancient Mesopotamian architecture as well berber and mudbrick architecture found in north Africa, Middle-East or central Asia. On top of that, we used the work of Omar Abdullkader and Fred Taylor as references for building shapes.

# Difficulties
During this short but very intense development, I had to learn to make a multiplayer system, communicate to the server, synchronizing all clients, create a lobby system before even creating the shooting gameplay. It took me most of the development time to do so but I ended up with a result I am very proud of (if we take into account I had a limited time and was very new to multiplayer game development).

Another big issue I encountered was the physics, it was really hard to create from scratch the controller I had in mind. Most of my issues came from the wall climbing mechanics and the invisible walls which needed to prevent the player from climbing the arena limits without preventing them to climb building within the arena. If I had to work again on that project, I would spend some time working on a better feedback for those invisible walls that are not intuitive nor understandable.

Feedbacks in general are very poor as we rushed through the wall project without taking enough perspective.
The scoreboard for example is poorly designed (and bugged), the random colors representing the different players are not sync, thus confusing players in game. There is no clear indicator of a player joining the game nor there is a feedback on hit landed or taken.

# More of Sandy Fight
As the servers were downed after some time without using them, you cannot experience Sandy Fight for now.
I am currently working on the issue and will be updating this page when it is back up. Thanks or your patience.
