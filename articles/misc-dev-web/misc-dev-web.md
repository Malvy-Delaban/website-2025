# About Lidle and Squordle
Lidle and Squordle are two mini games in which you need to respectively find a League of Legends champion and a Pok√©mon that has been randomized by the web site. This project comes from a frustration I felt from friends of mine. They played the "LoLdle" and "Squirdle" and wanted to have more that one guess to make each day. I used it as an excuse to try to make as fast as possible, a web site that replicated that behavior.

You can play my games using those links (from left to right: Lidle and Squordle):

# About Weighted Roulette
Weighted Roulette is a simple tool that allows you to roll for different things at random BUT with weighted choices. For example, if you got the choices "read a book" with a weight of 3 and "take a drink" with a weight of 1, there will be 3 chances out of 4 that you roll "read a book". The randomness always fascinated me and I was a sad not finding such a tool online so I created it myself.
The UI/UX is poorly designed but it is functionning well.

# About Random Valorant Agent
This one is a simple tool that will pick at random a Valorant Agent. As I was trying Valorant, I was a bit frustrated never knowing waht to play as I don't play it a lot and don't know the agents. I created a random agent selector that allows you to remove from the pool each agent you do not own in game. On top of that, I made it based on the official API of Valorant. This way, I do not have to update it with every new agent. (While taking a screenshot for this page, I am discovering characters I didn't even know about! what a great tool!)

# About Prompt Generator
AI are a big subject in creatives industries nowadays. I personnally think that we should not use it to create content that will be used in a product. But I think giving access to AI tools for creators to use as a base is a great way to improve productivity and ideas generation. This tool is something that helps me create dreamy / weird environment I wouldn't think about at first. It simple takes a random architectural style, a context / environment / weither, picks random colors and generate a prompt to use in an image generating AI. I run stable diffusion locally to generate pictures with this prompt and it helps me create really interesting environment to give me some ideas for future projects. You can find some examples of such environments below.
