# About Skip The Beat
Skip The Beat is my first "complete" game, created as the final project during my first year in game design at ESMA Toulouse. The project spanned two months, where the goal was to develop a 2D platformer from concept to completion. This was a solo project, where I was responsible for all aspects, including game design, development, and creative direction.

# Tools
For the music, I used Soundraw.io, an AI tool to generate tracks since I didn't have time to learn music production alongside game development.
For the game itself, I used the following tools:

• Unity
• Procreate (for concepts arts and illustrations)
• Adobe Illustrator (for the logo)
• Blender (for some 3D meshes I didn't use in the end)

# Concept
Skip The Beat is a 2D platformer and rhythm game. The gameplay is divided into two parts:

1. Song Creation: In this step, you choose patterns of maps to build your level. Each level has a tempo, difficulty, and part of the music.

2. Gameplay: The goal is to complete the level while interacting with the rhythm of the music. The challenge is to create a song that's easy enough to beat in the 2D platformer section but challenging enough to score points.

Once you successfully complete the level without failing, your song is considered "complete," and you've effectively won the game.

# Story
Moky, a rising music artist known for her electronic tracks, has hit a creative block. After gaining recognition through a successful feature, she can’t seem to find her next idea. One evening, a friend introduces her to Xochi, an AI music tool that helps artists create songs with customizable tracks.

Curious, Moky tries out the AI, only to discover that it’s actually a rhythm game, where she must play along with the generated music. This twist is what drives Moky to find her inspiration and creativity once more.

In-Game Characters:

• Moky: A modern, electronic music artist with a design inspired by Daft Punk helmets, LED screens, and fast-paced music.

• DJ Xochi: A reinterpretation of Xochipilli, the Aztec god of music, arts, and playfulness. His design merges traditional Mexican elements with modern musical accessories, blending old and new styles.

# Character design
DJ Xochi is based on the Aztec god Xochipilli, representing passion, love, music, and playfulness. I added modern elements like large golden jewelry and hip-hop-inspired accessories, which reflect contemporary music culture.

Moky represents modern electronic music, with a design inspired by Daft Punk and LED screens. Her winged helmet and sleek look represent her fast, energetic personality and the rhythm of her music.

# Ripomatik
During pre-production, I created a "ripomatik"—a video editing compilation of various movie clips, music, and images—to communicate the mood and artistic direction of the game. While it’s a powerful tool to convey a vision, it can also lock someone into a particular perspective of the project.

# Dynamic Sound interpretation
Skip The Beat features dynamic, sound-responsive elements, where the environment adapts to the music. For example, the background in the menus and in-game visuals rotate and scale based on the tempo of the currently playing music.

To achieve this, I developed a custom tool in Unity that provides real-time feedback of the music's frequency spectrum. It enables me to adapt game elements (like visuals and movement) based on the music's bass, treble, or general tempo.

This tool was inspired by some of the work from Peer Play.
Watch their example here:

# Map generation
The game allows players to create music by selecting pre-made 15-second sections and adjusting tempo and difficulty. Once the song is built, it transitions into the 2D platformer segment where the level is constructed based on the tempo and music.

The level’s difficulty depends on the choices the player makes in song creation. Selecting "very hard" sections can make the level nearly impossible, demanding precise timing and careful movement to succeed. To make the music engaging, players are encouraged to vary the tempos throughout the level.

# Difficulty and Balancing
Balancing Skip The Beat proved challenging, as players often created levels that were too difficult and struggled to complete them. To improve playability, I decided to replace the "death on hit" mechanic with a "hit count," allowing players to train without constantly failing.

Players can now try to minimize their hits and engage in friendly competition, adding a sense of rivalry among playtesters. This adjustment significantly reduced frustration and improved overall gameplay.

# Play Skip The Beat
