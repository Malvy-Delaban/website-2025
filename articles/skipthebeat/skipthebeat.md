# About Skip The Beat
This project is the very first "complete" game I created. It was the final project of the first year in game design at ESMA Toulouse. It is a 2 month long project were the goal was to create a 2D platformer. We needed to create the universe, general mood, search for inspirations and create the game from A to Z. This is a solo project.

# Tools
For the musics, I used Soundraw.io to create AI generated songs as I didn't think I could learn music creation in 2 months on top of the development of the game.
For the other parts of Skip The Beat, I used :

• Unity
• Procreate (for concepts arts and illustrations)
• Adobe Illustrator (for the logo)
• Blender (for some 3D meshes I didn't use in the end)

# Concept
Skip The Beat is a 2D platformer and rythm game. The game is simple, in the first part, you have a menuing step in which you choose wich patterns of map you'll play in your level. Each level is associated with a tempo, a difficulty and a part of the music.
The goal is to make a music that is easy enough to beat in the 2D platformer but hard enough to give you some points. On top of that, your creativity is needed to create your own music.
Once the game is finished, if you have succesfully finished the level without it, your song is considered "complete" and you basically won.
