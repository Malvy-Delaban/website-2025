# About Blodscinn Wrath
Blodscinn Wrath is a Game Concept in which the player is controlling, in TPS view, a character in an endless city. There is no goal nor lose condition. Just the loneliness of the player inside the never ending city landscape. The city is procedurally generated with a dozen buildings in a neo-classical architectural style.

The world of Blodscinn Wrath is an interpretation of the Judeo-Christian mythology that pictures the Heavens in a dark fantasy approach where God is a tyrant that uses his angels as a militia and dead people as slaves to build the never ending city to house even more upcoming mortals. A rebellion broke out and God was killed. Most of rebels were slaughtered by the rest of the angel forces that now wanders in this silent corpse-filled maze.

# Context
Blodscinn Wrath was created in the context of my third year of the ESMA, a game design school. We were asked to create a game concept we could present to a jury. The main things we were asked to do are : creating a game concept with the 3C well defined, creating some moodboards, writing the basis of the lore. I wanted to push the project further and presented a 3D scene in engine in which I recorded a short Game Concept Trailer you can watch below.
This project took 3 weeks to create.

# Inspirations
My inspirations for this project were very diverse but one of the biggest was the painting "The Fall of Babylon" by John Martin with this shred, menacing and complex sky. Hidetaka Miyazaki was obviously a huge inspiration too with those landscapes you can travel such as Anor Londo or Farum Azula with great architectures. Tsutomu Nihei and his manga Blame! was the main inspiration for the never ending structure that always feels oppressing. On top of that, a lot of existing neo-classical building inspired the building I created.

# Development
To be the most efficient as possible, I started to create my scene in Engine with blockouts of the shots I wanted to show in the trailer. I spent a significant amount of time trying to setup a lighting that represented the vision I had for this scenary. That includes creating the HDRI for the red sky and testing the general mood with different approaches.

When I was satisfied with the mood and my blockout, I modelled every building. I tried my best to make it modular so I can re-use some parts on other buildings such as windows and columns/pillars for example. I also textured the building in a way I could use the materials for multiple assets. It helped a lot since I ran out of time at the end of the project and had to be efficient.

For the characters, as I am not the best sculpt artist, I spent more time than needed on it but I ended up with a result that I'm really proud of. Even though this part took a long time, the process was really smooth and efficient. I had all my references ready, made a blockout of the character, started sculpting, did the retopology, the texturing and the rig in less than a week (which was a third of the time I had for the project).

# Tools
To make this project, I used :

• Unreal Engine 5
• Blender (Modeling, Sculpting, Riging)
• Substance Designer (Building textures)
• Substance Painter (Blodscinn textures)
• Illustrator (The logo)
• Photoshop (The HDRI)

It was a challenge for myself as I learned how to do 3D modeling in 3ds Max, how to sculpt on Zbrush and how to rig on Maya but I wanted to train myself on other software too so I used Blender for all three tasks.

I also used two AI tools.
The first one was Suno.ai for the trailer music as I did not have the time to teach myself how to create the trailer music.
The second one is Stable Diffusion. It helped me create the HDRI, I used John Martin's painting as a base, made modifications on photoshop, used the AI to adapt it to the style and shapes I wanted, went back and forth between the two softwares a few times and finally used the AI to make it "spherical" without distortion for the HDRI.

# Final Render
At the end of the project, I had a trailer that was really close to the vision I had for this project. I finished earlier than expected on top of that and that made me really proud. I had to create things for it that I had never done before or that I was really bad at. For example, the logo or the animations of the camera were hard to do since I had no experience in doing them but I'm now really proud of the whole project.
