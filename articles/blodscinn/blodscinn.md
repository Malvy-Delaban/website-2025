# About Blodscinn Wrath
Blodscinn Wrath is a Game Concept in which the player is controlling, in TPS view, a character in an endless city. There is no goal nor lose condition. Just the loneliness of the player inside the never ending city landscape. The city is procedurally generated with a dozen of building in a neo-classical architectural style.

The world of Blodscinn Wrath is an interpretation of the Judeo-Christian mythology that pictures the Heavens in a dark fantasy approach were God is a tyrant that uses his angels as a militia and dead people as slaves to build the never ending city to house even more upcomming mortals. A rebellion broke out and God was killed. Most of rebels were unalived by the rest of the angel forces that now wanders in this silent corpse-filled dedal.

# Context
Blodscinn Wrath was created in the context of my third year of the ESMA, a game design school. We were asked to create a game concept we can present to a jury. The main things we were asked to do are : creating a game concept with the 3C well defined, creating some moodboards, redacting the basis of the lore. I wanted to push the project further and presented a 3D scene in engine in with I recorded a short Game Concept Trailer you can watch below.
This project took 3 weeks to create.

# Inspirations
My inspirations for this projects were very diverse but one of the biggest was the painting "The Fall of Babylon" by John Martin with this shred, menacing and complex sky. Hidetaka Miyazaki was obviously a huge inspirations too with those landscapes you can travel such as Anor Londo or Farum Azula with great architectures. Tsutomu Nihei and its manga Blame! was the main inspiration for the never ending structure that always feels oppressing. On top of that, a lot of existing neo-classical building inspired the building I created.

# Development
To be the most efficient as possible, I started to create my scene in Engine with blockouts of the shots I wanted to show in the trailer. I put an important amount of time trying to setup a lighting that represented the vision I had for this scenary. That includes creating the HDRI for the red sky and testing the general mood with different approches.

When I was satisfied with the mood and my blockout, I modelled every building. I tried my best to make it modular so I can re-use some parts on other buildings such as windows and columns/pillars for example. I also textured the building in a way I could use the materials for multiple assets. It helped a lot since I ran out of time at the end of the project and had to be efficient.

For the characters, as I am not the best as a sculpt artist, I spent more time that needed on it but I ended up with a result that I'm really proud of. Even if the realisation of this part was long, the process was really smooth and efficient. I had my references ready of everything I needed, made a blockout of the character, started sculpting, did the retopology, the texturing and the rig in less than a week (which was a third of the time I had for the project).

# Tools
To make this project, I used :

• Unreal Engine 5
• Blender (Modeling, Sculpting, Riging)
• Substance Designer (Building textures)
• Substance Painter (Blodscinn textures)
• Illustrator (The logo)
• Photoshop (The HDRI)

It was a challenge for myself as I learnt how to 3D model on 3Ds Max, how to sculpt on Zbrush and how to rig on Maya but I wanted to train myself on other softwares too so I used Blender for those three tasks.

I also did use two Artificial Intelligence.
The first one being Suno.ai for the trailer music as I did not have the time to teach myself how to create the trailer music.
The second one is Stable Diffusion. It helped me create the HDRI, I used John Martin's painting as a base, made modifications on photoshop, used the AI to adapt it to the style and shapes I wanted, went back and forth between the two softwares a few times and finally used the AI to make it "spherical" without a pinch for the HDRI.

# Final Render
At the end of the project, I had a trailer that was really close to the vision I had for this project. I ended up earlier than exepected on top of that and that made me really proud. I had to create things for it that I never did or was really bad at. For example, the logo or the animations of the camera were hard to do since I was not educated on how to do them but I'm now really proud of the whole project.
